Scope. This license covers ONLY the model weights released in this repository.
Project code and datasets are licensed separately.

Grant. You may use, reproduce, and redistribute the Model and create derivatives for RESEARCH AND
BENCHMARKING, subject to the Restrictions below. Include this license with any redistribution.

Restrictions (Prohibited Uses).
- No operational or safety-critical decision making (e.g., compliance, emergency response,
  credit/insurance/risk scoring).
- No surveillance, tracking, targeting of persons/property, weaponization, or military/intelligence uses.

  calibrated Sentinel-2 (or any real) measurements.
- Do not present synthetic outputs as real satellite data without clear disclosure.
- Obey all applicable laws (privacy, export, anti-discrimination).

Provenance & Disclosure. Keep file-level provenance (e.g., synthetic=true, pipeline=caption→RGB→MSI,
pipeline_version, seed). Publications/demos must disclose that outputs are synthetic.

Attribution. Cite the corresponding paper and repository when using the Model or derivatives.

Termination. Any breach of the Restrictions terminates this license automatically.

Disclaimer. THE MODEL AND ANY OUTPUTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
